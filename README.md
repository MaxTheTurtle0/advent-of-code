# advent-of-code
This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place throughout the month of December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants solve it using their preferred programming language.

Solutions
I have provided solutions for each day's challenge in three different languages: Rust, Python, and occasionally C. The solutions are organized into separate directories for each day, following the format dayXX, where XX represents the day number.

Inside each day's directory, you will find the following folders:

- C (C solution)
- Python (Python solution)
- Rust (Rust solution)


# Note on Comments
Please note that the solutions provided do not contain any comments.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any part of the code, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be more than happy to assist you and provide further explanation.
